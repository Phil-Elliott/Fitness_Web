1) Figure out how to save new signups
2) Use react query to fetch the data
3) connect user profile to the user data in settings

4) Have the user get directed to the landing page after they sign out
5) Figure out how to save the user information on the server when the user signs up


Maybe just add zusted instead of redux
Look into t3 and zod
add testing


Could add equipment to the activity
add option to add a alternative if you don't have the equipment at the exact time







A calendar view would be good but should that just be its own page or something you can do on the activitys page


- Maybe add some sample data to the database to display
1) Make the active workout page
    - make sure it connects to the database and saves workout and also saves so you can continue if you leave the app
2) Start making the schedule page
       Same as google calendar or similar

3) Maybe have the + button do different things based on dates being shown
